										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">Atlético Madrid chairman Enrique Cerezo took part in a talk at the Complutense University of Madrid on Tuesday and <b>took attendees somewhat by surprise with his forthright comments on João Félix</b>, who the club sent out on loan to Chelsea in the January transfer window. While discussing several players who may or may not return to the Spanish capital for next season, Cerezo suggested <b>new Blues boss Mauricio Pochettino</b><b> isn’t a fan of the Portuguese star.</b></p>
<h3 class=""><b>João Félix’s unorthodox loan move to Chelsea</b></h3>
<p class="">After a much-publicised falling out between Félix and Atleti boss Diego Simeone earlier in the season, the 2020/21 LaLiga champions shipped the former Benfica playmaker off to London, with Chelsea paying a reported €8 million fee for the privilege of taking him on loan until the end of the season. In an unusual move, <b>Félix extended his contract in Madrid until 2027</b> before heading to the Premier League.</p>

<h3 class="">Chelsea’s season to forget</h3>
<p class="">The Blues had endured <b>a torrid first half of the season</b> and hoped his signing, along with that of several others, could inspire them to greater things. Instead, <b>Félix was sent off on his debut</b> against Fulham and <b>scored just four goals in 16 Premier League games</b> as Graham Potter was sacked, <b>Chelsea finished in the bottom half of the table</b> and were eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter-finals.</p>
<h3 class="">Portugal star “not in Pochettino’s plans”</h3>
<p class="">The Portugal international is far from being solely to blame, it should be said, but Cerezo’s comments suggest<b> in-coming manager Pochettino hasn’t been too impressed with what he has seen</b> from the 23-year-old.</p>
<p class="">“We found out less than 24 hours ago that <b>he’s not in the plans of the new </b><b>Chelsea</b><b> coach</b>. He’ll come back once his loan deal is over and then we’ll see what happens. <b>We don’t have any plans on what to do with him</b>, but he’s an Atlético Madrid player”, Cerezo explained.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mauricio Pochettino has decided that João Félix will not play at Chelsea next season, Atlético president Enrique Cerezo confirmed.</p>

<h3 class="">What does the future hold for João Félix?</h3>
<p class="">The <b>future doesn’t look especially promising for Félix in Madrid</b>, given that the whole reason he left was because of his fractured relationship with Simeone, who doesn’t look to be going anywhere just yet. On top of that, Atleti have improved considerably in the second half of the season without him, which doesn’t bode well in an on-field context either.</p>
<p class="">Will <b>another move</b> be on the cards in the summer?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="">After a 31-year wait to reach the final of a European competition, <b>AS Roma</b> have now done so in two consecutive seasons under the guidance of <b>José Mourinho</b>.</p>
<p class="">In his first year in charge the enigmatic coach secured the club’s <b>first European triumph since the 1961 Inter-Cities Fair Cup</b>, beating Feyenoord in the inaugural season of the Europa Conference League.</p>
<p class="">Mourinho now leads the team into the Europa League final against Sevilla on Wednesday. The 60-year-old has won all five of the European finals in which his teams have played, but he insists that he is paying no attention to his impressive record.</p>
<p class="">“I don’t think too much about what happened before,” he said in an interview with UEFA. <b>“What happened, happened.”</b></p>
<p class="">“The difficult moments with [those] feelings, you also don’t forget them, but you get used to living with them. <b>And I always look forward</b>. Maybe that’s my secret or my philosophy, of being in football for so many years, so this final for me is a new final.”</p>

<h3 class="">Mourinho claims that history does not play a part</h3>
<p class="">The Portuguese coach has led Porto, Inter Milan, Manchester United and now Roma to continental titles. Last year he become the<b> first manager to win all three UEFA club competitions.</b></p>
<p class="">He has managed some of the most well-known clubs in world football, most notably Chelsea and Real Madrid, but knows that it takes more than reputation to win in the crucial games.</p>
<p class="">“<b>History doesn’t win matches at all</b>. You look at Real Madrid’s finals and you think Real Madrid wins every final,” he said.</p>
<p class="">“You look at Sevilla and you say Sevilla wins every final. But the reality is that history doesn’t win matches.</p>
<p class="">He continued: “<b>Superstition is something that I don’t like</b>, so I don’t look at superstition even as a factor.”</p>

<h3 class="">Mourinho praises “incredible quality” of Europa League</h3>
<p class="">Roma have knocked out some very talented teams on their way to this final against Sevilla. In the knock-out stages they have eliminated Champions League-bound <b>Real Sociedad</b>, Dutch champions <b>Feyenoord </b>and a <b>Bayer Leverkusen </b>side who have impressed under Xabi Alonso.</p>
<p class="">Mourinho was eager to emphasise his team’s achievement, reaching a second consecutive final, given the opposition in this season’s tournament.</p>
<p class="">“To be in this final is something that nobody would have expected at the beginning of the season when you see the incredible, incredible quality of the teams in the Europa League,” he said.</p>
<p class="">“<b>Barcelona </b>and <b>Arsenal </b>were in this competition and they were kicked out very, very early.”</p>
<p class="">He added: “<b>For Roma to be in this final, it means a lot</b>. So let’s try to give [the fans] the ultimate happiness.”</p>
